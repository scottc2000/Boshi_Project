Comments: The methods are have good naming convention and are easy to understand. LoadBlocks() loads each blocks sprite sheet cordinates. Update() is self-explanatory. Draw()'s switch case maps a number to each block type even though it's not explicitly stated. Could have used a dictionary for explicit mapping, but this works. The Block class handles all block information as expected.
