Comments on Quality: There's no coupling with is great! No need to reach into other people's stuff. SaveSpriteLocation may be handled by other "things" in future sprints, but it's a helpful method. This can be reused for other "static" drawings such as some items and background decor.
Hypothetical Change: I don't have any hypothetical changes
