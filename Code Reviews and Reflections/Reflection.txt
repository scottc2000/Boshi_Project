Sprint Reflection
Overall, the team performed decently this sprint. Although we were able to complete most of the assigned tasks by the deadline, our time management could improve greatly for future sprints. In terms of a burndown chart, our progress could be represented by a line with a gentle downward slope for the first two and a half weeks. Upon reaching the final day, the line would plummet at a very steep decline since most of our work was completed in the final twenty four hours before the sprint was due. Since this was our first team sprint, we were unsure of the overall workload and how much work we should have been completing each day. For the next sprint, we plan on pacing ourselves better and spreading the workload more proportionately throughout the three weeks so that we do not have a repeat of this Sprint's rushed conclusion.
